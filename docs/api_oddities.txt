Envelope
    - Why is there no Coord2D version of re_center()?
    - Don't 'intersects' and 'contains' do the same thing for points?
    - Why is there no Coord2D version of init()?

Feature
    - Is getNumGeometries inconsistent met Map getXXXCount
    - Why is props std::map<std::string,value>, not a Parameters object?

Geometry
    - num_points -> getPointCount

Map
	- no removeFontSet, removeAllFontSet - inconsistent with style operations
	- insert_style should be called add_style for consistency
	- add remove_all_styles for consistency with Layers

- Return of shared_ptr is inconvenient because no release(). What is the datasource_deleter for?
- Why does one add a style to a layer by name, and not by its pointer?

- MAPNIK_EXPORT in DATASOURCE_PLUGIN(classname)
